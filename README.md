if you wanna use this figure it out urself for now. batch file is broken btw and not even valid rn. use a better os. 
also no wayland rn aliou is working his ass off. hopefully.
bad.py has shitty click detection but the AI still doesn't know how to use it correctly. uhhh someone else can fix that i spent WAAY too long on image detection with CLIP scoring and tesseract bounding boxes and shit and it still thinks stuff that clearly wont work will since I didn't want to let it re-import the libraries for torch etc over and over again.

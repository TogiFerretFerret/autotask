if you wanna use this figure it out urself for now. batch file is broken btw and not even valid rn. use a better os. 
also no wayland rn aliou is working his ass off. hopefully.
bad.py has shitty click detection but the AI still doesn't know how to use it correctly. uhhh someone else can fix that i spent WAAY too long on image detection with CLIP scoring and tesseract bounding boxes and shit and it still thinks stuff that clearly wont work will since I 

update i let it reimport because it has no slowdown anymore but i cant test rn anyways bye probably dont run bad.py its really slow since the image_finder is painstakingly slow.
